          <p>I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
            arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you
            and
            me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

            it:
            the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>
